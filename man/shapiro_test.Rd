\usage{
shapiro_test(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the data to be tested for normality.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the p-value from the Shapiro-Wilk test.
A small p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that the data significantly deviates from a normal distribution.
}
\description{
Performs the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality on a numeric vector.
}
\details{
This function applies the Shapiro-Wilk test to a numeric vector to assess whether the data follows a normal distribution.
It returns the p-value from the test, which can be used to determine if the null hypothesis of normality should be rejected.

\examples{
# Example of using the shapiro_test function
data <- c(1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.7, 5.0)
shapiro_test(data)
# Returns the p-value from the Shapiro-Wilk test
